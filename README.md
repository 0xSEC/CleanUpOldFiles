# Clean up old files

This is a script which allows you to delete files and empty directories which are older than *N* days.

## Usage

To use, call the script as such:

    python cleanup.py --path=/my/path/to/delete --days=5 --force

## Notes

I used this as an exercise to help me learn python in general and also unit testing.

Code reviews, comments, and pull requests are all very welcome.
